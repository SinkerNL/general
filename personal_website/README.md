# My Personal website

In this project I will create a personal website. In first instance it will exist out of a simple frontend, created with a tbd framework.

After just having a simple front end, the idea is to somehow extend this with some sensor data from home, just to play with a raspberry pi, sensor data and sending the data to the cloud somewhere (or just locally). Also to be able to play with gitops and similar technologies.

Afterwards, the framework should be extended with something more in the neighbourhood of Flutter. I want to be able to learn flutter to be able to make apps both for Android as for Apple.

## Initial requirements phase 1
- Simple backend
- Simple frontend
- Closed loop (connect frontend to backend)

## Initial requirements phase 2
- Host the website somewhere (raspberry pi, or preferably AWS, or a combination of both), but keep it simple!

## Initial requirements phase 3
- Create a blog, where I keep track of the things I learn. 
- tbd

tbd tbd tbd.
